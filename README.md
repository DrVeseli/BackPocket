PocketBase CLI VPS deployer

This is not for production code, dont use if you have actual users, this is for testing, it runs on root, not safe at all.

Steps: 1. Get a VPS anywhere, make it run ubuntu (pref the last LTS) 2. Run the executable from the releases or clone the rep and run "go run main.go" 3. You will be prompted for the IP of the server, the username is root and the password is the root pasword for the server (not safe, use it just for testing) 4. Your api is at http://IP/api, dashboard http://IP/\_

DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE ACTUAL USERS, DONT RUN YOUR SERVERS WITH ROOT, THIS IS FOR FUN AND TESTING

IT ALSO RUNS ON HTTP NOT HTTPS BE CAREFUL
